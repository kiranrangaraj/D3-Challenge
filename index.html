          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>When comparing the different population statistics, several positive correlations are observed. Obesity, smoking,
            and lack of healthcare rates correlate to both poverty rates and household incomes. Generally speaking, the higher the 
            obesity, smoking, and lack of healthcare rates are, the higher the state's poverty rates are or the lower the median
            household income is.
          </p> 
          <p>The scatterplots visually indicate that these trends are not absolute as outliers are evident.
            For example, Texas has the highest percentage lacking healthcare (24.9%) yet a poverty rate of 17.2%, which
            is towards the median poverty rate. Conversely, Washington DC has nearly the same poverty rate as Texas at 17.7%, but 
            only 8.3% of its population lacks healthcare and only 17.7% (the second lowest %) are obese.
          </p>
          <p>Some states that clearly display the positive correlation include Mississippi, Louisianna, and Arkansas, which have 
            some the highest poverty rates as well as obesity, smoking, lack of healthcare rates. These three states not surprisingly
            also have some of the lowest median household incomes.
          </p>
          <p>Age however, does not appear to present a clear correlation to obesity, smoking, or healthcare percentages. This is
            visually evident by the fact that the scatter plot appears as a cluster for all 3 of these variables. Most of the states 
            having median ages between 36 and 40 years old. A weak positive correlation appears for smoking and median age, where it
            seems states with higher age medians tend to have higher smoking rates. Again though, this connection appears loosely.
